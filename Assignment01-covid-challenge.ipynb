    "### Due:  Jan 31, 2025 before 8AM ET\n",

    "---\n",
    "This notebook contains essential functions for your assignment. You will need to enhance and write additional code to complete the tasks. Please submit your completed work to the designated GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is crafted to assess your proficiency in Python programming. You are encouraged to solve the problems using your current knowledge and skills, refraining from searching for solutions online. Be aware that future assignments in this course may present more complexity than this initial task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For your project, please adhere to the following straightforward requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Python 3:** Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Format:** Your code should be presented in one of two formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a single Python script, saved with a .py file extension.\n",
    "* As a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "These requirements are essential to ensure that your code is compatible and can be executed smoothly in our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Information\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be working with a dataset available from [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/omicron-covid19-variant-daily-cases?select=covid-variants.csv). Additionally, a copy of this dataset is located in the same directory as this Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides information on the processing of COVID-19 sequence data by different countries over a period of time. It is formatted as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, containing the following six key columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `location`: This column indicates the specific country to which the data pertains.\n",
    "2. `date`: This column shows the date on which the data was recorded.\n",
    "3. `variant`: This column identifies the specific COVID-19 variant related to the data entry.\n",
    "4. `num_sequences`: This column reflects the count of sequences that have been **processed** for the respective country, variant, and date.\n",
    "5. `num_sequences_total`: This column indicates the total count of sequences that are available for the specified country, variant, and date.\n",
    "6. `perc_sequences`: This column indicates the total count of sequences that are available for the specified country, variant, and date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset corresponds to the record of sequences processed for a particular COVID-19 variant in a specific country on a given day."
